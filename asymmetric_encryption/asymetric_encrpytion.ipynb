    "## Introduction: The Tale of Bob and Alice - Securing Communication with Asymmetric Encryption\n",
    "In the digital age, privacy and security are paramount, especially when two people, Bob and Alice, need to exchange sensitive information over an insecure channel (email, chat or similar internet communication channels). \n",
    "This exercise will take you on a journey where you, the learner, help Alice and Bob securely communicate using asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, but they know that their communication could be intercepted by malicious third parties, like Eve the Eavesdropper. The solution? Encryption using asymmetric keys! Through this exercise, you'll help Alice and Bob establish a secure line of communication using encryption and decryption techniques with public and private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adventure will take place on a single computer (your own), where you'll simulate both Alice and Bob, each with their own set of keys. We'll guide you step by step to help them exchange encrypted messages, decrypt them, and ensure their communication is safe and sound.\n",
